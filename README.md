#GL_C/Embedded_BaseCamp

This is repo for my future projects in BaseCamp

Wokshop_1:
implement custom blinking sequence with 4 leds

Workshop_2:
implement at least 3 blinking schemes for all 4 LEDs on the board
2 buttons would be used to select scheme (next one, previous one).
2 buttons would be used to select blinking speed (speed up, slow down).
Button at the middle of cross should be used to turn on/off blinking.
All buttons need to be processed by interrupts.

Workshop_3:

implement PWM signal generator.
Time4 need to be used (this is mandatory).
STM32F407 need to be switched for external clock (HSE).
2 buttons would be used to set signal frequency (up and down; +/- 5 kHz step).
2 buttons would be used to set duty cycle (+/- 5% step each button press).
Middle button would be used to select signal output (PD15, PD14, PD13, PD12 or no output (disable case)). Cyclic selection scheme.
